			<p>Our names are Patricia & Willem, originally from The Netherlands but now living our dream in The Dominican Republic. We decided to come here to pursue a different  life with more time for each other and our family. That the climate is a lot better here than in Holland is a big bonus, the most we enjoy here are the friendly Dominican people, the nature and the tranquility without all the big problems Europe (also The United States, Canada and Russia) is having at this time.</p>

			<p>We speak Spanish, English and Dutch and we have associates that speak native Italian, French, German and Russian.</p>

					My life in Holland was first all about horses, coaching and my passion for photography. Later on, I had a company that cooperated with Dutch and Belgium Real estate companies for photographing and filming real estate, I even flew with drones! I was also hired to make houses sales-ready. From advice about color changes to major makeovers.<br/><br>

					Not only because of my coaching experiences, I really love working with people in combination with homes. Homes are emotion and I comprehend that. <br><br>

					It’s my proper goal to find the best home for you in the Dominican Republic!

					My career in The Netherlands was mostly sales management in technical environments,  such as big housing projects, office buildings, and high way constructions. The most I loved about this was finding the right partners and to think out of the box with them to come up with environmentally better solutions, within the field of Cradle to Cradle, Upcycling and total cost of ownership. My real estate passion was born there. Real estate became not only buildings for me, but they had a function to fulfill with respect to people and the environment. <br><br>
My dream here in the Dominican Republic is to live off the grid and Patricia and I are investing in that right now.  What’s your dream? Let me be of help in that quest. <br><br>
